# RC_car-lane-detection
Now, let's go through each line in detail:
pythonCopy code
import cv2
This line imports the OpenCV library, which is used for computer vision tasks like image processing and object detection.
pythonCopy code
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
This line initializes the camera to capture video frames. The 0 parameter specifies the index of the camera. If you have multiple cameras connected to your computer, you can select a different camera by specifying a different index.
pythonCopy code
out = cv2.VideoWriter('output.avi',cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc('M','J','P','G'), 10, (640,480))
This line initializes the video output to save the processed video frames to a file. The first parameter 'output.avi' specifies the filename of the output file. The second parameter cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc('M','J','P','G') specifies the codec used for encoding the video. The third parameter 10 specifies the frames per second (FPS) of the output video. The fourth parameter (640, 480) specifies the resolution of the output video in pixels.
pythonCopy code
lower_threshold = 50
upper_threshold = 150
These lines initialize the lower and upper thresholds for the Canny edge detection algorithm. These thresholds control the sensitivity of the algorithm to edges in the image.
pythonCopy code
while True:
This line begins a loop that will continue until it is manually broken. The loop reads frames from the camera, processes them for lane detection, and displays the output.
pythonCopy code
    ret, frame = cap.read()
This line captures a single video frame from the camera and stores it in the frame variable. The ret variable is a boolean that indicates whether the frame was captured successfully.
pythonCopy code
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY
